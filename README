copyCctStatus.rb is a ruby script for gathering status information from the
    Cell-CT graphics server to the projects directory on lancer

cctConfig is a json file that defines key/value pairs for Cell-CT instrument
    names and corresponding IP addresses

	Removed the ucm_logs copy code from copyCctStatus.rb and moved it
	into the ruby script file getLatestUcmLogs.rb. Before I did this
	the function would copy all the log files generated the day before
	over to lancer. New the version of this function copies all the logs
	generated so far today that have not been copied over.


	The configuration files for the individual cct's were named cctXXX_config,
	where XXX was the serial number for the cct. The configuration files have
	been renamed cctXXX (without the _config suffix)
